# H99

### Description

- This is a set of 99 problems that should be solved with haskell that can be found [here](http://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems).
- This project has as a single objective: help me learn haskell
- Even though some solutions may seem suboptimal im trying to stick to recursion most of the time rather than using built in functions.
- I am using solely the tests provided on the problems page as a way to check the functions. Each exercise has 1-3 tests associated with them. The tests are implemented using hspec.
- To check the tests i just run `stack test`.
- Any suggestions and tips are welcome.

p.s: i want to make more robust testing for edge cases later on since there are very few tests on the website for each problem so it definetely does not guarantee that functions work correctly.
