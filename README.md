# H99

### Description

- This is a set of 99 problems that should be solved with haskell that can be found [here](http://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems).
- This project has as a single objective: help me learn haskell
- Even though some solutions may seem suboptimal im trying to stick to recursion most of the time rather than using built in functions.
- I am using solely the tests provided on the problems page as a way to check the functions. The tests are implemented using hspec.
- To check the tests i just run `stack test`.
- Any suggestions and tips are welcome.
